summary: Small town Sheriff based out of Southern Oregon looking to find a job with a bit of a slower pace. I'm a little exhausted
  dealing with the likes of alternate universes, giant lasers, and time travel. Would appreciate being able to drink my coffee and 
  not worry about it taking me to 1945.
